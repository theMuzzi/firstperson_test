# firstperson_test
Just a small project I'm making to test first-person movement.

Messing with some physics and stuff lol
Might create a game out of this, idk for now.

Also I mean you can use it if you want, but I'm a beginner and my code my suck by comparison to some other available ones, so don't if you don't want to lmao
